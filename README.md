# 🧍‍♂️ Player Re-Identification Using YOLOv11 and DeepSort

## 📌 Overview

This project implements real-time player detection, tracking, and re-identification in a 15-second football video using:

- **YOLOv11** – for fast and accurate object detection (fine-tuned on player class)
- **DeepSort** – for maintaining unique and consistent player IDs across frames

It ensures that each player retains the same ID throughout the video, even after occlusion or re-entry.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to detect and track football players with unique IDs throughout a short 15-second clip using the provided YOLOv11 model.
